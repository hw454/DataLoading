# DataLoading

Takes spreadsheets from supplmenary material and creates csv files for analysis. 
There is still a significant amount of manual input with entering row numbers and sheet names. 
The programme will load the data from the supplementary table along with loading the outcome.ids. 
The `outcome.ids` are used with OpenGWAS to load the remaining SNP level data.
